"""Base network layer: USDC balance, deposit scanning, withdrawals.

This module is the bot's single chain facade. It keeps the battle-tested
monolithic helpers used by handlers/web/tests (which patch `base.w3` /
`base.usdc` directly), and re-exports the layered `bot.chain.*` toolkit
(`base.core`, `base.prices`, basename/price/DEX readers, ...) so callers and
tests can use the richer primitives. See bot/chain/__init__.py.
