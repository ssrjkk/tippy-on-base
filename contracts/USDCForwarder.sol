/// @notice Shared implementation behind every CREATE2 per-user deposit proxy

///         user never costs gas and every user keeps a deterministic deposit
///         address derived from their tg_id.
///
///         Lifecycle of a deposit:
///           1. User sends USDC (and/or ETH) to their unique proxy address.
///           2. The bot calls `forward()` on the proxy (or the user can call
///              it themselves — funds always go to the configured hot wallet).
///           3. This contract pulls the full USDC balance to the hot wallet
///              and sends any ETH held by the proxy to the hot wallet.
///
///         Security notes:
///           - No admin/withdraw: a proxy can never route its balance
///             anywhere except the hot wallet configured at construction.
///           - USDC and hot wallet are immutable, set once at deployment.
///           - Anyone may call forward(); it is a safety sweep, not a
///             privileged operation, and it cannot steal (target is fixed).
