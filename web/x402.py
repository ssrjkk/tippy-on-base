"""x402 endpoint: AI agents pay USDC tips over HTTP.

Protocol (https://github.com/coinbase/x402):
  1. Agent POSTs /api/x402/tip?recipient=<user>&amount=<usdc> with no
     payment header -> 402 Payment Required + x-402-* headers describing
     the invoice (recipient address, amount in micro-units, expiry).
  2. Agent sends USDC on Base to that address.
  3. Agent repeats the request with `x-402-payment: <tx_hash>`.
  4. We verify the Transfer on-chain (USDC -> our address), credit the tip
     to the Telegram recipient, and return 200. Same tx_hash twice -> 409.

The tx hash is the PK of x402_payments and the deposit scanner skips it,
so a payment is never credited twice and liabilities stay exact.
