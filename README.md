A Telegram bot that turns any chat or community into a financial ecosystem:
**instant USDC tips, Polymarket-style prediction markets with live AMM odds,
an AI assistant, paywalled content, and per-user wallets** — all on Base.
No custom contracts in the hot path: only the official USDC contract plus an
optional audited-style treasury vault; everything else is instant internal
accounting backed by public proof-of-reserves.

## Features

### 💸 Instant tips (zero gas)
- `/tip 5 @nick` — or reply `/tip 5` to any message
- Recipient gets an immediate DM notification
- 🌧️ `/rain 10 [N]` — scatter USDC across active group members
- 🔥❤️⚡👏🎉 emoji reactions tip the message author (groups)

### 📈 Prediction markets v2 — Polymarket analog (LMSR AMM)
- `/market create 50 Who wins? | Alice | Bob 7d` — creator funds the AMM liquidity
- **Live odds that move with demand** — Hanson's Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule,
  exact `Decimal` math (`b = subsidy / ln(n)`)
- `/trade <id> <opt> <amount>` — buy outcome shares at the live price
- **`/sell <id> <opt> [50%]` — sell back any time before resolution** (exit anytime,
  not locked until the end like parimutuel pools)
- `/positions` — your portfolio with live mark-to-market value and PnL
- Resolution pays **1 USDC per winning share**; the market creator keeps the
  remaining liquidity pool as their earnings
- **Guaranteed solvency by the LMSR funding theorem**: the escrow can always
  cover the worst-case payout, verified by property tests along aggressive
  random trading paths
- Deadline pings + grace-period auto-refund protection for forgotten markets

### 🎲 Parimutuel polls (quick group games)
- `/bet create Question | Option 1 | Option 2 [24h]`, `/bet <id> <opt> <amount>`
- Winners split the whole pot proportionally (2% fee on net profit to the creator)
- Inline cards, quick-amount buttons, two-tap resolution, cancel/refund paths

### 🎯 Cally — Polymarket on Base (`/oc*`)
- `/oc_create 50 Who wins? | Alice | Bob 7d` — creates a market in the
  **OutcomeMarket.sol** contract: the subsidy is locked on-chain, shares are
  real **ERC-1155 tokens**, every trade is a USDC transfer anyone can verify
  on Basescan
- `/oc_buy <id> <opt> <amount>` / `/oc_sell <id> <opt> [50%]` — trade at the
  live LMSR price with hard on-chain slippage caps (`maxCost`/`minProceeds`)
- `/oc_redeem <id>` — pull resolution payouts straight from the contract
- `/oc <id>` / `/oc_pos` — live odds and your ERC-1155 positions
- Oracle proposes the winner, the owner can dispute within 2h (once —
  after a dispute only the owner finalizes), and anyone can
  refund an abandoned market 24h after close — refunds are hard-capped at
  $1/share so the creator subsidy can never be drained
- Labels live in a bot-side registry (the contract stores numbers only); gas
  for first trades is auto-topped-up from the hot wallet with a per-wallet
  anti-drain cooldown
- Deploy: `python scripts/deploy_outcome_market.py` (owner should be a
  multisig, not the hot wallet)

### 🧠 AI assistant
- `/ask <question>` — ask about crypto, Base, market strategy, bot usage
- Works with **any OpenAI-compatible API** (OpenAI, OpenRouter, local vLLM/llama.cpp)
  via `AI_API_URL` / `AI_API_KEY` / `AI_MODEL`
- Reply to a message with `/ask` to use it as context; rate-limited, typing indicator

### 💛 Donations & wallets
- `/donate` — personal donation page with QR (`t.me/<bot>?start=donate_<id>`)
- Deposits auto-credit with push notifications (Basescan tx link included)
- `/link <address>` + signature → automatic deposit crediting (ecrecover-verified;
  a deposit can only be claimed by the wallet's owner — never by tx-hash sniping)
- `/wallet` — built-in custodial wallet, export/import by seed phrase
- `/withdraw <address> <amount>` — on-chain payout (1% fee, min 1 USDC, ≤5/day),
  full auto-refund for stuck/reverted transactions
- `/tx <hash>` — look up any Base transaction and decode its USDC transfer

### 🏷 Basenames (on-chain identity on Base)
- `/basename` — your on-chain name (ENSIP-19 reverse resolution of your deposit
  address against the Base L2 resolver); shows in `/wallet` and the public
  donate page automatically
- `/basename <name>.base.eth` — on-chain availability check: free (with a
  registration hint), taken (owner address), or **confirmed yours** when it
  resolves to your linked/custodial wallet
- Tips by name: `/tip <name>.base.eth` resolves the basename to its on-chain
  owner — the chain is the source of truth, nothing is stored bot-side

### 🔐 Paid content & channels
- `/paywall create 5 Title` → sell posts for USDC (buyers read instantly)
- `/paywall channel 5` → paid Telegram channel access, 5 USDC / 30 days,
  one-time invite links, expired subscribers auto-kicked
- **x402 HTTP payments**: `POST /api/x402/tip` and `POST /api/x402/paywall` —
  AI agents pay on-chain via the 402 handshake (invoice → pay → replay-proof credit)

### 🤖 Autonomous agent (fail-closed)
- Perceives crypto news → LLM filters noise → creates markets, bets, sells
  analysis as paywall posts — **every action EAS-attested on Base**
- News sources: CryptoPanic (with `CRYPTOPANIC_TOKEN`) plus free RSS fallbacks
  (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph); deduplication and relevance scoring built in
- Runs inside the main process (`deploy/run.py`) when `AGENT_TG_ID > 0` and the
  cap set validates — no separate service needed; a silent agent death stops
  the process like any other watcher (fail-fast)
- State (caps counters, seen-news, audit trail) lives in `AGENT_STATE_DIR`
  (default: the `agent/` package dir) so a restart never resets the daily cap
- Spend is capped in code (never in the prompt): daily + per-tx caps, actions
  per hour, circuit breaker with cooldown; caps are validated at startup and
  the agent refuses to run on a misconfigured set
- LLM failure = no action (fail-closed); the agent can never trade on its own
  markets (DB-level guard)
- `/agent` (admin-only) — live caps state, circuit-breaker status and the
  agent's recent actions straight in Telegram, no web dashboard needed

### 🖥 Web dashboard (public transparency)
- Live stats, volume chart, markets with odds/backers, leaderboards, user profiles
- **Proof of Reserves** `/api/solvency`: bot liabilities vs on-chain USDC
  (read from the TipBotVault contract when deployed, else the hot wallet)
- **Base design system UI** — light (default) + dark theme with a toggle
  (Base White/Black #F8F9FB / #0A0B0D, Primary Blue #0052FF)
- Public JSON API: `/api/stats`, `/api/markets`, `/api/predictions`,
  `/api/prediction/{id}`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/health`, `/qr`, rate-limited per IP

### 🪄 Smart Wallet (ERC-4337) — gasless, non-custodial
- **Per-user Smart Accounts** via CREATE2 (`SmartAccountFactory`) — deterministic
  counterfactual addresses; no ETH needed from the user
- **VerifyingPaymaster sponsors gas** — users tip/trade without ever holding ETH
  (Base Sepolia proven: direct `handleOps` and gasless paymaster UserOps, status=1)
- `bot/smart_wallet.py` builds + signs UserOperations (EIP-191) and drives
  `approveAndTrade` from the wallet's own USDC
- Details: `docs/ECOSYSTEM_DESIGN.md` §8

### ⛓ On-chain treasury (TipBotVault)
- Users deposit USDC into the vault contract — visible to anyone on Base
- Relayer distributes under a daily limit; owner (multisig) keeps full control
- `Distributed` events make every payout publicly auditable
- Deploy: `python scripts/deploy_vault.py` (compiles with solc 0.8.24, EIP-1559 fees)

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt          # + requirements-dev.txt for tests
cp .env.example .env                     # fill BOT_TOKEN, BASE_RPC_URL, HOT_WALLET_KEY
python -m bot.main                       # bot
python -m uvicorn web.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000   # dashboard
```

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Get a Base RPC (Alchemy / Infura / QuickNode free tier — the public
   `mainnet.base.org` is unstable for `eth_getLogs`)
3. Fund the hot wallet with ~$5 ETH for withdrawal gas
4. Optional: set `AI_API_KEY` to enable `/ask`

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build   # postgres + bot + dashboard + hourly backups
```

Services: `db` (PostgreSQL 16), `bot`, `web` (healthcheck on `/api/health`),
`backup` (pg_dump every 6h, 14-day rotation). Local port 5433 to avoid clashing
with a system Postgres.

Full production walkthrough: **[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)**.

```

## Testing

```bash
docker compose up -d db       # PostgreSQL for tests (port 5433)
python -m pytest tests -q     # 750+ passed
```

What is tested *for real* (not mocked): money conservation across every flow
(tips, fees, refunds, parimutuel payouts, rain, **AMM buy/sell/resolve/cancel**
— balances + escrows always sum to deposits), deposit-security (claiming
someone else's tx is rejected), fee math, real signature recovery, the full
aiogram dispatcher with real Update objects, USDC ABI decoding, the FastAPI
dashboard against a real ledger, background watchers, 14 end-to-end scenarios,
and 12 TipBotVault tests on a local EVM (eth-tester + py-evm). Only external
networks are mocked (Telegram transport, RPC).

The LMSR engine additionally has a property test proving the funding theorem:
along randomized aggressive trading paths the escrow never drops below the
worst-case payout.

## Security

- `HOT_WALLET_KEY` is money — never commit `.env`
- Recommended treasury setup: hot wallet = relayer only (daily-limit capped by
  TipBotVault), owner = multisig
- Official USDC only: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- Prediction markets rely on the creator resolving honestly; deadline + grace
  auto-refund bounds the damage of abandoned markets
- Anti-spam cooldowns, per-day withdrawal limits, gas-griefing protection
- Sensitive commands (`/withdraw`, `/deposit`, `/claim`, `/link`, `/confirm`,
  `/export`, `/import`, `/paywall subscribe`) answer only in private chats;
  the daily withdrawal cap is enforced atomically in the database
- All bot output is HTML-escaped (no Markdown injection from user titles);
  the dashboard serves a strict CSP (nonce-based scripts) with zero inline
  event handlers; web login nonces are single-use with a TTL and pruned
- Multi-relayer withdrawals keep per-relayer daily caps in a persisted state
  file (a restart cannot reset the budget); relayer keys and caps are
  validated by `python scripts/validate_env.py`
- The autonomous agent is fail-closed: LLM errors mean no action, caps are
  validated at startup, and the DB blocks trading on its own markets

## Roadmap

- Per-user deposit addresses (CREATE2 vaults) ✅
- ~~Smart Wallet (ERC-4337) + gasless paymaster~~ ✅ core shipped + Sepolia-proven (P2)
- ~~Withdrawal batching for gas savings~~ ✅ shipped (queued payouts flushed as a batch; multi-relayer pool with persisted daily caps)
- Order-book style CLOB on top of the AMM
- ~~On-chain market escrow (trustless resolution via UMA-style oracle)~~ ✅ shipped as **Cally** (OutcomeMarket ERC-1155)
