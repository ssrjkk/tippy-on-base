"""On-chain market registry: metadata, trade log, resolution lifecycle.

The registry is off-chain bookkeeping only (labels + winner DMs); real
holdings live in ERC-1155. These tests pin the invariants the bot relies on:
idempotent registry writes, per-outcome aggregation for winner notifications,
and the deadline/overdue queries driving the onchain watcher.
